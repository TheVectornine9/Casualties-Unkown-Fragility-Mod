# Casualties-Unkown-Fragility-Mod
*info:*

This is probably the first ever mod for Casualties Unknown. What the fragility mod does is it makes all Traps instant death. Plus some dialogue when you open the console.


# the mod:
Unfortunately, the entire game files will not be included; you are going to have to download the base game yourself.

Instead, to install: 
Replace the DLL file from
game folder\CasualtiesUnknown_Data\Managed
With the DLL in this repository.

All this really does is replace the built-in code with my code.

The source code for this will not be available.
